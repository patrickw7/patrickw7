## 🙋‍♂️ About Me

Some time ago I found huge passion in web development completely by accident. From this point, I am trying to constantly learn and improve, because only by hard-work I can improve my skills and be a better programmer every day. The first thing that I have noticed, front-end developer is a bit like an artist.  We have real influence on the shape and the final effect of our creativity. Only imagination is limiting us in our own projects and that's so cool!
